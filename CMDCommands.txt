REN (Rename) command. 

The Copy command allows you to copy files from one location to another.
To use this command, type "copy location\filename.extension newlocation\newname.extension".

To copy a folder and its content from a location to another, use the XCOPY command followed by the "/s /i" operators. 
Let's assume that we need to copy a folder from "D:\Digital_Citizen" to "C:\Backup_Digital_Citizen.
" To do that, we have to run the command "xcopy /s /i d:\Digital_Citizen c:\Backup_Digital_Citizen."
The "/s" parameter ensures that all the directories and subdirectories are going to be copied, except the ones that are empty.
The "/i" parameter creates a new directory if the destination folder does not exist and copies all the files in it. 

The DEL (Delete) is used to delete files from the folders you have created.
To delete all the files from a folder, you can run the command "del folder.

The DEL command cannot be used to delete folders.
Therefore we must use another command to remove any empty folder: RD (Remove Directory).
We have previously deleted all the files from the Digital_Citizen_Tests folder.
It is now time to delete the directory too, by typing "RD Digital_Citizen_Tests."

To run a program from the Command Prompt, 
you need only to navigate to the folder that contains the executable and type the program's name. 
For example, if you want to launch Paint using Command Prompt, go to "C:\Windows\System32", 
where its executable is: mspaint.exe. Let's see how this operation is done if you were in "D:\Digital_Citizen."
First of all, change the working directory to the application's folder by typing "cd /d c:\windows\System32\"
